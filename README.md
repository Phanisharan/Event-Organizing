## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setting Up MySQL on Railway
1. Deploy MySQL on Railway using the following steps:
   - Go to Railway and create a new project.
   - Deploy a MySQL instance using the Railway template.
   - Use the environment variables provided by Railway to connect to your MySQL instance.

2. Update your `settings.py` in Django to use the MySQL database:
   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
           'NAME': 'your_db_name',
           'USER': 'your_db_user',
           'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
           'HOST': 'your_db_host',
           'PORT': 'your_db_port',
       }
   }
   ```

## Integrating Cloudinary with Django
1. Install the Cloudinary Django SDK:
   ```bash
   pip install django-cloudinary-storage
   ```

2. Add `cloudinary_storage` and `cloudinary` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:
   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       ...
       'cloudinary_storage',
       'cloudinary',
       ...
   ]
   ```

3. Configure Cloudinary settings in your `settings.py`:
   ```python
   CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {
       'CLOUD_NAME': 'your_cloud_name',
       'API_KEY': 'your_api_key',
       'API_SECRET': 'your_api_secret',
   }

   DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
   os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://your_api_key:your_api_secret@your_cloud_name"
   ```

4. Use Cloudinary for image uploads in your Django models:
   ```python
   from django.db import models
   from cloudinary.models import CloudinaryField

   class Event(models.Model):
       title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
       description = models.TextField()
       date = models.DateField()
       image = CloudinaryField('image')
   ```

## Running the Project
1. Migrate the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. Create a superuser to access the admin panel:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
